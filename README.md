- Xcode 13+ for building the project

## Installation

### From Source

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MusicWidgetApp.git
   ```

2. Open the project in Xcode:
   ```bash
   cd MusicWidgetApp
   open MusicWidgetApp.xcodeproj
   ```

3. Update the Bundle Identifier and Team in the project settings to match your Apple Developer account

4. Build and run the application (‚åò+R)

## Usage

1. **First Launch**: When you first launch the app, click "Login with Spotify" to authenticate
   
2. **Add Widget**: 
   - Open the Notification Center by clicking on the time in the menu bar
   - Click "Edit Widgets" at the bottom
   - Find the "Spotify Widget" in the widget gallery
   - Choose either small or medium size and add it to your desktop

3. **Control Music**:
   - Play/Pause: Click the play/pause button
   - Next Track: Click the forward button
   - Previous Track: Click the backward button

4. **Widget Updates**: The widget automatically refreshes every 5 seconds to show your current track

## Configuration

### Spotify API

The app uses the following Spotify API permissions:
- `user-read-playback-state` - To read your current playback state
- `user-read-currently-playing` - To see what's currently playing
- `user-modify-playback-state` - To control playback (play, pause, next, previous)

### App Settings

- The app runs as a menu bar application for convenience
- Song data is cached locally in your user Documents folder
- Album artwork is cached for offline viewing

## Troubleshooting

### Playback Control Issues

If you experience issues with playback controls:

1. **Check Spotify Connection**: Ensure Spotify is running on your computer
2. **Refresh Authentication**: Try logging out and back in if the authentication expires
3. **Use Desktop App**: This widget works best when controlling the local Spotify desktop app

### Widget Not Updating

If the widget doesn't update with the current track:

1. **Force Refresh**: Open the main app and click "Force Refresh Widget"
2. **Check Spotify Status**: Ensure Spotify is playing music
3. **Restart Widget**: Remove and re-add the widget to the Notification Center

## Technical Details

### Architecture

The app consists of two main components:
- **Main App**: Handles authentication and serves as a configuration panel
- **Widget Extension**: Displays track information and handles playback controls

### Control Methods

The app uses a hybrid approach for reliability:
1. **Primary Method**: Spotify Web API for rich data and remote control
2. **Fallback Method**: Local AppleScript commands when API calls fail

## Privacy

This app:
- Does not collect any user data
- Stores authentication tokens locally in a secure container
- Caches song data and artwork locally for performance
